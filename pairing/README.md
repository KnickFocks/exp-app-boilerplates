# Pairing App

When in pairing mode, the pairing app will show the pairing code on screen and listen for the pairing event. If the pairing event is received, the credentials are stored and the player is restarted.

If the player goes offline, the pairing app will abort. The pairing code is shown for half of the pairing authentication tokens lifespan.
